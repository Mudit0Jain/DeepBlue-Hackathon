# Gate Detection Using OpenCV
This project utilizes OpenCV to detect gates in a video. The script applies several image processing techniques such as sharpening, edge detection, and Hough Line Transformation to identify and highlight gates. It processes each frame of the video to detect parallel lines and draw bounding boxes around them.

## Requirements
*Python 3.x
*OpenCV
*NumPy
